#There are various tools for variant annotation. Among them, one tool I particularly felt useful is ANNOVAR.
#This software is useful when you need to do customization for database of your interest. To my knowledge, customization of DB is especially needed 
#when you are studying variants of patients whose ancestry is under-represented in mostly-used population databases, such as gnomAD, ExAC and so on.
#ANNOVAR was then supporting customization of DB, but now the script needed for customization is not offered in the offical release. So I shared here the codes that ANNOVAR offered before and how to utilize them for the purpose.

Step01. Please download the database (VCF format) you want to customize on your local server. 
# Here, I am going to use ToMMo 60K dataset, a largest Japanese population database completed by Tohoku group. download link: https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/downloads/ 

Step02. Please run the following code.
[path_to_perl_script]/convert2annovar.pl -format vcf4 [path_to_database_you_want_to_customize]/tommo-60kjpn-20240904-GRCh38-snvindel-af-autosome.vcf.gz > tommo.avinput

Step03. Please run the python code. ## The code for this step should be edited up to what information you want to annotate from the database.
python Edit_to_annovarDBfmt.py

Step04. Plsease run the following code for indexing the customized DB for annovar annotation. The step should ouput .txt file and .txt.idx file in [path_to_annovar_humandb]/humandb directory.
[path_to_perl_script]/index_annovar.pl tommo_annov.bed -outfile [path_to_annovar_humandb]/humandb/hg38_tommo.txt

Step05. Ready to annotate variants with custmized DB!

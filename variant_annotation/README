#There are various tools for variant annotation. Among them, one tool I particularly felt useful is ANNOVAR.
#This software is useful when you need to do customization for database of your interest. To my knowledge, customization of DB is especially needed 
#when you are studying variants of patients whose ancestry is under-represented in mostly-used population databases, such as gnomAD, ExAC and so on.
#ANNOVAR was previously supporting customization of DB, but now the script needed for customization is not offered. So I shared here the codes that ANNOVAR offered before for customization and how to use them for the purpose.

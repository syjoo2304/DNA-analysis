Dragen, a cloud-based platform that allows access to the GATK pipeline via Illumina's service, offers exceptional speed and accuracy, making it highly recommendable for clinical settings.
However, there are situations where managing the GATK pipeline locally is necessary, especially when working with large population datasets on closed servers to ensure privacy. In such cases, the computational speed can pose a significant challenge.
The code shared here includes techniques and optimizations I found particularly effective in improving the speed of the GATK analysis pipeline, specifically for processes like HaplotypeCaller and GenomicsDBImport.
